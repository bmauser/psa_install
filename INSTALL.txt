STEPS TO INSTALL SKELETON APPLICATION:
--------------------------------------

1) Make a new directory for your application and extract all the files
   from the downloaded archive into it.

2) Create a new database and run .sql file to create initial tables.
   Use db_mysql.sql for MySQL database or db_pgsql.sql for PostgreSQL 
   database.
	
3) Edit app/psa/config_override.php file and change:
	* database name in $PSA_CFG['pdo']['database']
	* database username in $PSA_CFG['pdo']['username']
	* database password in $PSA_CFG['pdo']['password']
	
4) If you are using Apache web server, make sure that mod_rewrite is 
   enabled. Edit .htaccess file and change the line with RewriteBase 
   directive if your application is not in web server root folder.
   Note that Apache web server will ignore .htaccess file if 
   AllowOverride directive is not properly set. You can set AllowOverride 
   to 'All' for the folder where you placed your application in Apache 
   configuration file.
	
5) Make sure that web server (user under the web server is being run as) 
   can write to directory: app/templates/smarty/templates_c

6) Register files for autoloading. There is a helper command line script 
   app/psa/register_files.php for that. Call it in shell with command: 
   php register_files.php
   By default, it will generate app/psa/autoload_data.php file.
   When running register_files.php script you need to have write 
   permissions to app/psa directory.
	 
7) You should see login screen if you open your new application URL
   in web browser. Log in with: 
	username: psa
	password: psa
	
8) Start building your own application. Make changes to the files, delete 
   _INSTALL folder, delete code you don't need, change templates...
