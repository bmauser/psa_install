HOW TO INSTALL SKELETON APPLICATION:
------------------------------------

1) Make a new directory for your application. Copy all extraxted files into your new application directory.

2) Create a new database and create tables using .sql file:
	http://phpstartapp.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/install/db_mysql.sql (for MySQL database)
	 or
	http://phpstartapp.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/install/db_pgsql.sql (for PostgreSQL database)
	
3) Make sure that your Apache web server has mod_rewrite enabled

4) Edit .htaccess file and change line with RewriteBase directive if your application is not in your web server root folder.
   Note that Apache web server will ignore .htaccess file if AllowOverride directive is not properly set. 
   You can set AllowOverride to All for the folder where you placed your application in Apache configuration file.
	
5) Edit application/psa/config_override.php file and change:
	* database name in $PSA_CFG['pdo']['dsn']
	* database username in $PSA_CFG['pdo']['username']
	* database password in $PSA_CFG['pdo']['password']
	* path in $PSA_CFG['folders']['basedir_web'] (if your application is not in web server root folder)
	
	See comments in application/psa/config.php file for detailed description of values in config_override.php file.
	
6) Checkout (or copy) PSA files into app/psa directory. Skip this step if you downloaded skeleton with PSA included.
	 SVN repository to checkout from: http://phpstartapp.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/psa
	  or
	 just extract archive with PSA only into app/psa directory
	 (download archive from http://code.google.com/p/phpstartapp/downloads/list)

7) Make sure that Apache can write to application/templates/smarty/templates_c folder
	 
8) You should see login screen if you open your new application URL in web browser. Login with: 
	username: psa
	password: psa
	
9) Start building your own application. Make changes to the files, delete this file, 
   delete methods you don't need, change templates...
